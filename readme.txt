== Frequently asked questions ==

= My images are over 2MB now, will this still work =
Yes, we do not restrict original image sizes.  We do however recommend resizing the images first.  a 4000px image when compressed is still 4000px, so by resizing you immediately start off at the correst size, which can in some cases be 500% smaller
